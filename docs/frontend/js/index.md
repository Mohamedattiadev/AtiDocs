This guide gives you a clear and easy-to-understand overview of JavaScript — from what it is to what it can do.

## 1. What is JavaScript?

JavaScript (JS) is a **popular programming language** used to make websites interactive. Along with HTML and CSS, it’s one of the main tools used to build web pages.

## 2. Why JavaScript is Useful

- **Runs in Your Browser:** JavaScript lets websites respond to what you do — like clicking a button, typing in a form, or moving your mouse.
- **Works Everywhere:** It’s not just for websites! You can use JavaScript to:
  - Build **web servers** (with Node.js)
  - Create **mobile apps** (with React Native)
  - Make **desktop apps** (with Electron)

## 3. Key Features

- **No Need to Declare Types:** You can write `let x = 5;` and later change it to `x = "hello";`. JavaScript won’t complain!
- **Functions are Flexible:** You can treat functions like values — pass them around, return them from other functions, and store them in variables.
- **Objects Inherit from Objects:** Instead of using classes like in other languages, JavaScript uses something called **prototypes**. (Don't worry — ES6 added classes to make it easier!)
- **Great at Handling Events:** JavaScript is designed to deal with things happening on the page — like clicks, typing, or loading data from a server — without freezing or slowing down.

## 4. ECMAScript (ES) - The Standard

JavaScript is based on a set of rules called **ECMAScript**. New versions (like ES6, ES7, etc.) add cool new features to make coding easier and more powerful.
