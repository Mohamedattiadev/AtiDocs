# Fetch API and Async/Await

## 1- What is Fetch?

The **Fetch API** lets you make network requests (like getting data from a server).

```js
fetch("https://api.example.com/data")
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then((data) => console.log(data))
  .catch((error) => console.error(error));
```

---

## 2- Using async/await

```js
async function getData() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch("https://api.example.com/data");
    const data = await response.json();
    console.log(data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
}
```

## 3- Why async/await?

- Makes code easier to read
- Acts like synchronous code but works asynchronously

---

## 4- Async vs Sync

**Synchronous**: Code runs line by line, waits for each step.  
**Asynchronous**: Code can move on without waiting (non-blocking).

Example:

```js
console.log("Start");

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("This runs later");
}, 1000);

console.log("End");
```

1- ==console.log("Start");==

- This line is synchronous, so it runs immediately and prints: ==Start==

2- ==setTimeout(() => { console.log("This runs later"); }, 1000);==

- This is asynchronous. It tells the browser:

> "Wait 1 second, then run this function."
> But it doesnâ€™t stop the rest of the code from running.It continues right away.
> So instead of waiting 1 second here, the browser sets a >timer and moves on.

3- ==console.log("End");==

- This line runs immediately after setting the timer, so it prints: ==End==

---

- so final output

```
Start
End
This runs later

```
