# 🌐 DevOps Overview

**DevOps** is a modern software development culture that brings together **development (Dev)** and **operations (Ops)** teams to **collaborate, automate, and deliver** software faster and more reliably.

---

## 🚀 What is DevOps?

DevOps is not a single tool or technology — it's a **set of practices and cultural philosophies** aimed at:

- Reducing the gap between development and deployment
- Automating repetitive manual tasks
- Improving collaboration and accountability
- Delivering features faster with fewer bugs

---

## 🎯 DevOps Goals

- ✅ **Continuous Integration** (CI): Automatically test and merge code changes
- ✅ **Continuous Delivery/Deployment** (CD): Push code to production quickly & safely
- ✅ **Infrastructure as Code** (IaC): Manage infrastructure using versioned config files
- ✅ **Monitoring & Feedback**: Detect problems early and respond quickly
- ✅ **Scalability**: Build systems that can grow smoothly as demand increases

## 🛠️ Key Concepts & Tools

| Area                  | Tools / Concepts                   |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Version Control       | Git, GitHub / GitLab               |
| CI/CD                 | GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins |
| Containerization      | Docker                             |
| Orchestration         | Docker Compose, Kubernetes         |
| Web Servers / Proxies | Nginx, Apache                      |
| Infrastructure        | Terraform, Ansible                 |
| Monitoring            | Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack     |

## 🔄 DevOps Lifecycle

```text
Plan → Develop → Build → Test → Release → Deploy → Operate → Monitor → (Repeat)
```

This cycle helps teams ship features **faster, safer, and more frequently**, with automation and reliability built in.

---

## 💡 Why DevOps Matters

Without DevOps:

- Code works on your machine but not in production
- Manual deployments are risky and time-consuming
- Debugging and rollback are painful

With DevOps:

- Environments are reproducible (thanks to containers)
- Changes are tested and deployed automatically
- Teams collaborate more effectively
