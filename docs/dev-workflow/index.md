# üß∞ Development Environment

A **development environment** is the collection of tools, configurations, and workflows that you use to write, test, and run your code efficiently.

Whether you're building web apps, APIs, CLIs, or full-stack systems ‚Äî having a clean, consistent setup is essential for productivity and reproducibility.

## üí° Why It Matters

A well-crafted dev environment helps you:

- Code faster with proper editor and terminal tools
- Automate repetitive tasks
- Easily switch between projects
- Maintain consistency across machines or team members
- Avoid ‚Äúit works on my machine‚Äù issues

## üèóÔ∏è What You'll Find Here

This section includes a curated setup based on my personal workflow:

- ‚ú® Editor setup (VS Code, Neovim with Lazy)
- ‚öôÔ∏è Terminal workflow (tmux + shell)
- üìÅ Dotfile management (using GNU Stow)
- üß™ Helpful CLI tools and aliases

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Everything is optimized for **speed**, **keyboard-centric workflows**, and **reproducibility across machines**.
