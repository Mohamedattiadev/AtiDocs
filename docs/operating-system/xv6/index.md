# xv6 Kernel Overview

xv6 is a modern re-implementation of **Unix Version 6 (v6)** for educational purposes. It runs on **x86 architecture** and demonstrates how an operating system manages hardware and software resources.

## 0. History and Purpose

- **Created by:** `MIT` (Massachusetts Institute of Technology)
- **First release:** 2006 (as a teaching OS)
- **Why:** To help students understand the **inner workings of Unix** and operating system concepts with a **small, simple, and readable codebase**
- **Repository:** [xv6-public on GitHub](https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-public)
- **Target audience:** Students and OS enthusiasts

## 1. What is xv6?

- **xv6** is a simple, teaching OS for understanding kernel concepts
- Implements basic features of Unix: process management, file systems, system calls, and more
- Runs on **modern x86 hardware** or via emulators like **QEMU**

## 2. xv6 File Structure

### 2.1 Core Components

| Component         | Description                                                  |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **kernel**        | Main OS code, manages CPU, memory, devices, and system calls |
| **user programs** | Sample programs for testing (e.g., `ls`, `cat`)              |
| **Makefile**      | Builds the OS and compiles programs                          |
| **bootblock**     | Starts the OS at boot, loads kernel into memory              |
| **fs.img**        | File system image containing files and directories           |
